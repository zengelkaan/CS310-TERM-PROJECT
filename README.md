# PETCONNECT

PetConnect is a mobile application designed to connect pet owners and animal lovers through three integrated features: pet mating, adoption listings, and feeding point maps. The app creates a unified platform where users can match pets for breeding, post and discover adoption opportunities, receive reminders for vaccinations and adoption follow-ups, and locate nearby food points to support stray animals — all in one place.
